\section{Application Platform}

\textit{What platform will your project use?}

\textit{What is your expected application technology stack?} 

We'll be using Java IDE for our project and weâ€™ll be programming in Java/JDBC for the backend, React (Javascript/JSX) and CSS for the frontend as well as SQL*Plus/Oracle for DBMS. We will be using Github and Git for collaboration and work management.
