\section{Project Description}

\textit{What is the domain of the application?} 

The domain of our application is to represent the relationships present on a job board like Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. The primary responsibility of a job board is to match applicants (prospective employees) with companies (employers) and any open positions that they wish to fill. Additionally, each company will have recruiters that are assigned the responsibility of scheduling applicants to interview with their company. Our goal is to model the typical recruiting pipeline that a company, recruiter, and applicant would undertake --- from applying to receiving a decision regarding their candidacy and everything in between. 

\medskip 

\textit{What aspects of the domain are modelled by the database?} 

The database will model the entities that include Applicants, Companies, Recruiters, Job Postings, Interview, Decisions, Information Sessions, and their respective attributes. In addition,
the database will model the relationships between them including: scheduling, applying, posting (job postings), deciding (both ways), interviewing (both ways), and hosting (interview).
